In that year he is listed as having 200 sheep and 10 cattle and has to pay "tol" [#1]. Unfortunately the men of the entire massive "Colonie" are listed together, and we do not know exactly where he is. However, a very useful clue comes from a strange event. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">On 26 January 1789 Mattheus files an affidavit [#2] at the Graaff-Reinet Drostdy, testifying in the matter of the attempted suicide of a Khoekhoe mother who murdered her own child in the process. He describes that he was on his way to a General Commando in 1788 and went past the farm Brakkefontein, when the local Master of the Watch called on him to witness the scene. It so happens that this is exactly where the later town of Jansenville will be proclaimed. It is at the eastern end of the so-called Black Ridges <i>"Zwartruggens"</i>, the district where we find his brother Barend in later Muster rolls. Furthermore, in 1792, Mattheus and his two brothers all owe money to Elsje Visser, as recorded in her inventory [#3] of that year. The key point here is that the late Elsje owns three farms towards the eastern end of the <i>Zwartruggens</i>, near the Sondaghs River; that is, at the Jansenville of the 21st century. This supports the above conclusion. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">This places Mattheus in the dry part of the South Karoo; a country of extremely drought resistant plants, such as the ubiquitous <i>noorsdoring (euphorbia coerulescens), </i>the beautiful <i>vaal plakkie, </i>and the odd-looking<i> vingerpol</i>. It is also the indigenous home of the succulent shrub known in North America as the Money Tree (<i>plakkieboom </i>in South Africa) and other strange, prehistoric-looking <i>euphorbia</i> species, dotted with the odd <i>sweetthorn,</i> or flowering <i>boerboon.</i> This is country better suited to sheep and especially goats (Angora in the 21st century), and is certainly not good cattle range. It is excellent kudu country. Nothing could be more different from the origins of the family in the Danish Eiderstedt, or even Wellington in the Cape. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">Mattheus and his brother Barend, together with Mattheus' two eldest sons, Pieter Johannes and Barend Matthys, appear as members of the Second Company ("<i>Tweede Compagnie</i>") of the Militia Dragoons ("Dragonders") in an undated Muster Roll [#4] which we believe to be from around 1796, when the two youngsters were at least 16. They are led by men such as Tjaart van der Walt (later to die in battle near Hankey), Adriaan van Jaarsveld (later to die in the Cape Castle in the hands of the British), and the father of Louis Trichardt, the later Voortrekker leader. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">An undated Muster Roll document [#5]  has more detail and states that Mattheus has 4 sons and 3 daughters at this time. This checks with his recorded child baptisms by 1796/7. It also confirms his wife's name as being <i>"Anna Gous"</i>. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">Mattheus and his sons make an appearance--their first--at the end of Chapter 9 of the book <A HREF="https://hbooyens.wordpress.com/amabhulu-the-book/" target="_blank">AmaBhulu</A>. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">In 1803 we find Mattheus and his eldest son Petrus Johannes listed separately in the Swellendam "Colonie", possibly near Schilpadbeen at the eastern end of that Colonie [#6]. This census shows Mattheus with his four youngest sons and two youngest daughters. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">By 1807 his name is listed as operator of the government post (mail stop and requisitioning post) at the farm Schilpadbeen, shown below [#7]. This is where a mail rider or government official can get a fresh horse, a bed, and possibly some lead and powder on his way to the unstable Eastern Frontier. This would be the route taken 27 years later at the end of 1834 by Quartermaster General Harry Smith on his dash to the Eastern Frontier to shore up the defenses against the amaXhosa in the 6th Frontier War; Hintsa's War. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">Mattheus, elsewhere referred to as <A HREF="https://hbooyens.wordpress.com/amabhulu-topics/groot-matewis-schilpadbeen-se-mense/" target="_blank">"Groot Matewis Schilpadbeen"</A>, dies around 1816, because that is when his wife Anna turns up as widow at a baptism. There is no death notice for him. </p><p class="IndividualNotes"><img border="0" src="../gif/Schilpadbeen.jpg" width="900" height="558">   </p><p class="IndividualNotes">The five wings of the Booyens family are based on Mattheus' five sons, of whom three will depart the Cape Colony to seek their future in the Boer Republics. Today, the Frisian surname Booyens is largely a Free State and Transvaal name. Only a tiny fraction of the Booyens family of South Africa remains in the East and West Cape, descendants of the two eldest brothers. However, the names of those two eldest brothers, <i>Pieter Johannes</i> and <i>Barend Matthys</i>, are propagated by the rest of the Booyens families as a conseqeunce of the Afrikaans naming convention. Many of the descendants of Pieter Johannes and Barend Matthys have also moved to the north of South Africa. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">The 1843 Inventory of Mattheus' wife's estate records about <i>D Booyens </i>(son Daniel Jan Andries) and <i>M Booyens</i> (likely son Matthys Stephanus) : <i>"The above individuals have left the district for Natal and are stated to possess nothing". </i>In fact, both were in the Free State. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">For the references, see <a href="#references">below</a><font color="#FF0000" size="1" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><sup>#</p></div></td></tr></table><hr width="25" size="-2"></td></tr>

The entry states that they resort under "het Land van Waveren". That would be where Tulbagh is today. However, there was not yet a parish at George or Beaufort West, so their options were Graaff-Reinet, Tulbagh and Swellendam. Swellendam is behind the Outeniqua Mountains from the Lower Karoo, where we believe they resided. In 1808 we find Elizabeth and her husband in an Opgaafrol for the Graaff-Reinet "Colonie", which reads: <i>"David Senecal de jonge ... Elisabeth Booyens"</i> and notes that they have a daughter, one horse, 50 head of cattle, and 75 sheep [#2].<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>When they baptise daughter Geertruijd in George on 18 September 1813, they are listed as living at "<i>Oosthuyskraal</i>" in the Graaff-Reinet district [#3].<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>The 1814 Opgaaf has them living in the Traka District, east of what is now Prince Albert [#4]. At this point they have two sons and two daughters. There are nine "Hottentots" on the farm with them. They have a wagon and the obligatory ten draught oxen along with 19 head of breeding cattle. They also have 230 sheep and 45 goats.<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>The couple turns up as witnesses to a baptism by Elizabeth's younger brother, Daniel Jan Andries Booyens on 10 September 1821. The baptism is served by the Beaufort Parish of the Dutch Reformed Curch, but is conducted at home in what the entry refers to as "Winterhoek". We can only assume this refers to the little spot known as <i>Winterhoek</i>, squirreled behind the Groot Winterhoek Mountains near Steytlerville. It is situated at the foot of the highest mountain in the Southeast Cape, known today as <i>Cockscomb</i> [#5]. We do not know whether they have moved to this district.<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>In 4 July 1831 David Senekal turns up as witness for another baptism by Daniel Jan Andries, but this time he is without Elizabeth [#6]. There is no indication that the baptism is NOT conducted in the church at Beaufort West. This is the last trace we have of either David or Elizabeth.<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>We have thus far failed completely in our efforts to locate a death notice for either David or Elizabeth.

Most interestingly, the couple is again witness to a baptism in the same church on 20 June 1858, along with <i>Pieter Adriaan Booijens</i> and a lady whose name is given as <i>Sebella de Winnaar</i>. It is clear that this is none other than Pieter Adriaan Booyens, second son of Hermina's older brother, Matthys Stephanus. Pieter Adriaan is married to Isabella <u>Duvenhage</u>, the scribe obviously corrupting the rather rare surname Duvenhage to "De Winnaar", a mistake that will be understood by speakers of the Afrikaans language, much as Booyens is very often documented as "Williams" by English speakers.<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>      This result shows conclusively that the sons and daughters of Mattheus Booyens are maintaining contact despite moving from the Cape Colony to the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republics, and despite being separated by hundreds of miles and international borders in the mid-1800s.<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>      By 1864, when they draw up their will at Aliwal North, the couple is living on the farm <i>Kalkfontein</i> in the Caledon River District of the Orange Free State Republic.<br><img src="../gif/sp.gif" width=10 height=4><br><br>      When Pieter passes away in 1868, the couple is living on the farm <i>Klipdam</i> in the Rouxville region.

Cape Archives, 1/GR 3/16 no. 91; Judicial declarations, interrogatories and <i>insinuatien</i> in criminal cases 1786-1802: Declaration by Matthys Booyens, 26 January 1789. The document describes the events of August 1788 when Mattheus was on his way to a "general commando", and he was called to serve as witness by Dawid de Beer, then local Veldwachtmeester. The author has consulted with Dr. Susan Newton-King, author of <i>Masters and Servants on the Cape Eastern Frontier 1760-1803,</i> Cambridge Press, 1999. She has researched the event and describes it on p.135 of that publication. Her work has revealed that the event took place on Brakke Fontein, farm of Dawid de Beer, and the present author has investigated the placement of the De Beer family of the region. The relevant Brakke Fontein is located immediately southeast of the present Jansenville, on the Sondagh's river - the eastern end of the Zwartuggens. Other farms owned by members of the family are located nearby. So is Kommandokraal, which is no doubt where Mattheus was headed to report for local "general commando" duty in August 1788. </p><p class="IndividualNotes">#3.

The main farm is described as: "<i>Klyne Brakke Fontain geleegen aan deeze seide van de Sondags Rivier inde Swarte Ruggens</i>" .
